# Algorithm Lanes 100th Birthday Party

The local bowling alley is celebrating its 100th birthday. For the festivities they have held a bowling tournament. Of course they'd like to know the bowler with highest score, but also the bowlers who had scores of 100 or greater. They need an algorithm that will print the name and score of the winning bowler as well as the names and scores of bowlers with scores 100 or above.

# Cadillac vs Ferrari

Cadillacs are built for comfort, Ferraris are built for speed. In fact the Ferrari is twice as fast as the Cadillac on the DSA Speedway Track. The track can represented as a ten node linked list where the 10th node points to back to the head. 

	1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 1 [head]

Each node has a value of it's track section number.

If the Ferrari starts first and is able to move 2 nodes each turn, then Cadillac moves 1 node each turn, at what section number will Ferrari circle around to meet the Cadillac?

Visualize and step through your solution. The point is NOT to do in head.
